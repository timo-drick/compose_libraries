# Jetpack Compose previews for edge-to-edge design

Library which enables you to show WindowInsets in Jetpack Compose previews. Supported insets are the status bar, navigation bar and a camera display cutout. It also is able to show many different configurations of the system bars.

I moved this library to a dedicated repository on github here:
